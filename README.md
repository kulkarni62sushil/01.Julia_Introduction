# 01. Introduction to Julia 
## Introduction 
Learn the basics of Julia. These tutorials are for Julia beginners, so even if you have no prior knowledge of Programming, you wonâ€™t face any difficulty understanding these tutorials.
It will be easy for those who knows Python

Julia is a programming language used for statistical computations and data analysis. Julia is a combination of super-fast execution speed of C and flexible code writing of Python. Working with Julia is considered to be super fun and super easy among the Computer scientists and Software Engineers, because of its high efficiency.

## Installation 
Before starting with the installation process, you need to download it. 
Julia for Windows is available on its official site [![Julia](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Julia-9558B2?style=for-the-badge&logo=julia&logoColor=white)](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

Once installed, open Julia!! You will see a command-line interface. Now install IJulia from the Julia REPL by pressing ] to enter pkg mode and entering:

`add IJulia`

If you already have `Python/Jupyter` installed on your machine, this process will also install a kernel specification that tells `Jupyter` how to launch Julia. You can then launch the notebook server the usual way by running `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can have IJulia create and manage its own Python/Jupyter installation. To do this, type the following in Julia, at the `julia>` prompt:

`using IJulia`
`notebook()`

to launch the `IJulia` notebook in your browser.

### Installation from unofficial distributions

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome. 
Anaconda and Canopy comes pre packaged with all the necessary Juila libraries 
and also IJulia. 


### Anaconda

Download [![Anaconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-%2344A833.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=anaconda&logoColor=white)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

It is a free software and can be use to run `Python`, `R` and `Julia`

## Launching Julia 
Use
<a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="Jupyter" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-F37626.svg?&style=flat-square&logo=Jupyter&logoColor=white"></a> Notebook

and from the terminal type


`ipython notebook`

In Anaconda, Open the respective terminals and execute the above.
